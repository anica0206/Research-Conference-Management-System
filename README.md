# Project_Specification
In this project, your team is asked to design and develop a research conference management system. This 
system will help organise the submission of research papers, allocation to reviewers and making decisions on 
accepting or rejecting papers. 

The system should support at least the following key aspects. 
1. Support and manage different types of users and user profiles (i.e. system admin, conference chair, 
reviewers and authors). 
2. Support the authors to submit papers to a conference. A paper may have multiple authors and an author 
may submit multiple papers. 
3. Support the reviewers to bid for the papers they prefer to review and provide the maximum number of 
papers they would like to review. 
4. Support the conference chairs to allocate papers to reviewers. The allocation should take into the 
reviewersâ€™ bidding and their preferred workload (i.e. maximum number of papers). Allocation can be 
done automatically or manually. 
5. Support the reviewers to submit and edit their review and rating. Ratings can be: 3 (strong accept), 2 
(accept), 1 (weak accept), 0 (borderline paper), -1 (weak reject), -2 (reject), -3 (strong reject). Once a 
reviewer has submitted their review for a paper, they would be able to see the other reviews on the same
paper. They can then add comments to discuss the reviews. 
6. Support the conference chairs to view the reviews and ratings, and decide whether a paper should be 
accepted or rejected after the reviewing process completes. Once all decision have been made, the 
conference chairs should also be able to see a list of accepted and rejected papers and notify the authors 
accordingly via emails. The authors are then able to see the reviews of their paper and rate the review.
